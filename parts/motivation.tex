Modeling particle deposition in human air pathways is important for understanding regional particle deposition which is crucial for targeted drug delivery. Studies have shown potential health risks associated with ultrafine particles deposited in lungs. Traditional techniques of in vivo and in vitro face significant challenges. And the commonly used Lagrangian approach is computationally intensive as it involves the tracking and interpolating of millions of particles at each time step. Due to the intricate nature of finite element method data structures, parallelizing the particle deposition on GPUs poses challenges.
